# SRI LAKSHMI CATERING


The project is a webpage for Sri Lakshmi Catering Service, specifically the "About" page (about.html), designed to showcase a Hyderabad-based catering business established in 2012. Operated by Banupratap B and Bujjibabu, the page highlights their services for events like weddings, birthdays, corporate functions, and traditional gatherings, emphasizing customized menus featuring South Indian, North Indian, Indian, Chinese, Tandoori, Mughlai, vegetarian, and non-vegetarian cuisines. The webpage includes a header with a logo, navigation links to Home, About, and Contact pages, and a "Guest Login" button (though its functionality isn’t defined). The main section provides business details, including the address in Kukatpally, and offers interactive features: a "View Visiting Card" button linking to an image with contact numbers (9866633513, 9000063513, 9000908577) and service details, a "Show Location" button that toggles a Google Maps iframe of the business location, and a "View Catering Demo" button linking to a Google Drive video. The footer displays a logo, a tagline about their authentic cuisine and exceptional service, and social media icons for Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram (though the links need updating to the business’s actual profiles). A small JavaScript script manages the map toggle, and the page uses Font Awesome for icons and an external styles.css for styling. Overall, the project aims to inform visitors, build credibility, and engage potential customers with essential business information and interactive elements, though it could benefit from improvements like responsive design, SEO optimization, and functional social media links.
